### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile, where I share my transformation from teacher to Data Scientist.

My name is Efe, and I am a graduate student pursuing my Masters Degree in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics. My background does not compare to the traditional data scientist as I have also worked as a high school math teacher with over 5 years of classroom experience. My passion for data science arouse from teaching AP Statistics. I wanted to create a classroom experience that mimicked real life scenarios. In order to accomplish this, I learned how the data science industry and statistics merge to create impactful, life changing resources.

As you glance through these projects, you will noticed that my goal is to become an outstanding Data Scientist and Analyst. To accomplish this, I work hard to perfect my skills in the following:

-Probability and Statistics
-Programming, Packages and Softwares
-Data Wrangling
-Data Visualization
-Machine Learning/ Deep Learning

ðŸŽ’ I am currently learning:
-Analysis of Variance
-Logistic Regression
-Time Series

ðŸ’» I am currently using:
R, SAS, Python, SQL, Oracle, Hadoop
